ex2.m  
In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to
predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

x2 reg.m 
In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression
to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance
(QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure
it is functioning correctly.
